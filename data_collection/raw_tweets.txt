Correct me if I am wrong, but are the judges in American Idol in competition with each other, too? Thought this was a vocal event. My bad, heheh.
@CertifiedFMT I love me some dogs. However, in spite of severe cat allergies, they are pretty swell. My kiddo had cats, I took meds, and they were aloof until they weren't. Me too.
