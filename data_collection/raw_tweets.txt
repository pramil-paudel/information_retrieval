@sheldonkruk @yotestradecen Seat prices compared to lower bowl GRA are WAY higher. My lower bowl tickets averaged around $80 pregame at GRA. At ASU in same area average $140 per game. Coyotes management  raised the prices 6 days in the selection process from $90 to $140 per game, sense demand was so high.

He’s right. And Fox is right when they say worrying about climate is a Democrat narrative.Crime and climate are both important.
Literally this is the best relationship I’ve been in, yes mentally I’ve gone through things but I needed to go through those, had nothing to do w my relationship, just finally realizing life and what I need

@pmddomingos Sorry, but no. Europeans could breathe the air, drink the water, and grow crops in the soil of America. None of those are true for Mars.

It was fantastic once again hosting @mrwolfcomics @powells yesterday! Having worked an event for all five of the Mr. Wolf’s Class series, it almost feels as if I’ve grown up with these graphic novels, and they hold a special place in my heart. It was a pleasure!
