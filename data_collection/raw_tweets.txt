@jansportbyu @TanMart03 @tiffanee_dawn Is KAT really that bad defensively? He has the size and rebounds, scores, passes well. If you put a few other solid defenders at the 1, 3 and 4, I think that’s a better defensive team for small ball than what the Jazz currently have.
A ho is a ho. A working girl.

@patriottakes Dangerous nut job, whose followers might act out on his rhetoric.And harm those he targeted on his inflammatory programs.Free speech doesn’t give you the right or inclination to promote violence.A President and Congress, declaration of war is Constitutional.His is not.

I wish the Reds FO go because they have destroyed this franchise from top to bottom literally. If things don't turn around soon enough I can see this team with 130 losses. I hope that I'm wrong on this, but I don't see much of encouraging signs there.
