A note to Vladimir Putin:—Good day Mr. President. You have expressed great hope that your country aspire to its former greatnesses.In that endeavor, you bring about the opposite of those objectives. It isn’t too late to step back now.Stop the killing. Stop hating the world…

@Mimema12 @doyle_dearman He should’ve been investigated before the confirmation hearing. Since the Republicans had control of the Senate at the time, that information wouldn’t have made it to the hearing.

I'm not going to wait around for an apology that doesn't know needs to be expressed let alone WON'T BE. This person absolutely did A LOT FOR ME! I absolutely appreciate and acknowledge that but in no way at all does that grant you any allowance on the safety of my life So bye 👋

Then the universe literally said "bro....NOT COOL and a highway patrol officer pulls up to us (again, IN THE MIDDLE OF BUMFUCK NOWHERE) and sides with my friend and I and proceeds to scare the crap out of the aforementioned person lol it was honestly validation AF
This person then had the nerve to tell me I was being an asshole quickly followed by them pulling over to kick both me &amp; MY FRIEND out in the MIDDLE of the DESERT at  NIGHT. Unbelievable 🤯🤬😵

Why should I apologize for being a dick to somebody who was purposely driving INCREDIBLY recklessly and didn't give a fuck that they were ENDANGERING my life, literally, to play a game of "cut off cat and mouse" while simultaneously weaving around SEMI TRUCKS?!?!?!

@What46HasDone Right? It only seemed out of the normal for these folks because it’s the first time since the pandemic they’ve been confronted with the mere idea of eating inside. Something they think they think will permanently disable anybody who does with Long COVID. Completely lost the plot.
the fact that this is real and has better read metrics than a lot of major journal publications is fucking hilarious to me https://t.co/Ruj0ZvZwYs
