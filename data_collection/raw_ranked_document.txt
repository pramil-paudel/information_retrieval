@sheldonkruk @yotestradecen Seat prices compared to lower bowl GRA are WAY higher. My lower bowl tickets averaged around $80 pregame at GRA. At ASU in same area average $140 per game. Coyotes management  raised the prices 6 days in the selection process from $90 to $140 per game, sense demand was so high.|0.0
